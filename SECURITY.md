## Reporting a Vulnerability

### üö® For Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **Email**: Send details to the maintainers privately (use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting)
3. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if known)

### üìß Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week  
- **Fix development**: 2-4 weeks depending on complexity
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### üîí What We Consider Security Issues

#### Critical Security Issues:
- **Code injection** vulnerabilities in data processing
- **Unauthorized access** to system resources
- **Data exposure** of sensitive geological information
- **Denial of service** vulnerabilities in ML processing

#### Information Security Concerns:
- **API key exposure** for external data sources
- **Unauthorized data modification** in prediction algorithms
- **Privacy issues** in location-based analysis
- **Malicious input handling** in user-provided coordinates

### üõ°Ô∏è What We DON'T Consider Security Issues

- **Educational disclaimers**: This is research software, not production safety software
- **Prediction accuracy**: Scientific limitations in earthquake prediction
- **Performance issues**: Slow calculations or large memory usage
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: In third-party packages (report to those projects)

## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security
```bash
# Always use virtual environments
python3 -m venv earthquake_venv
source earthquake_venv/bin/activate

# Verify package integrity
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt

# Keep dependencies updated
pip list --outdated
pip install --upgrade package-name
```

### Data Security
- **Don't process sensitive location data** in production environments
- **Validate all input coordinates** before processing
- **Use secure networks** when fetching USGS API data
- **Keep generated maps private** if they contain sensitive infrastructure data

### API Security
- **Monitor API usage** to USGS and other external services
- **Implement rate limiting** if integrating into larger systems
- **Cache API responses** to reduce external dependencies
- **Validate API responses** before processing

## üöÄ Secure Development Practices

### Code Security
- **Input validation** for all user-provided data
- **Sanitize file paths** in output generation
- **Avoid eval()** or exec() with user input
- **Use secure defaults** in configuration

### Dependency Management
```bash
# Regularly update dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip list --outdated
pip install --upgrade package-name

# Audit for known vulnerabilities
pip audit
```

### Testing Security
- **Test with malicious inputs** (invalid coordinates, extreme values)
- **Validate error handling** doesn't expose sensitive information
- **Test file system permissions** for output generation
- **Verify external API error handling**

## üîç Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. **Educational Purpose**: Not designed for production safety-critical systems
2. **External Dependencies**: Relies on third-party APIs and libraries
3. **Input Validation**: Limited validation of geological data inputs
4. **Output Files**: Generated files may contain location information

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Clear documentation** about appropriate use cases
- **Input sanitization** where user data is processed
- **Error handling** that doesn't expose system information
- **Regular dependency updates** and security monitoring

## üìã Security Checklist for Contributors

When contributing code, please ensure:

- [ ] **Input validation** for all user-provided parameters
- [ ] **Error messages** don't expose sensitive system information
- [ ] **File operations** use safe path handling
- [ ] **External API calls** include timeout and error handling
- [ ] **Dependencies** are from trusted sources and up-to-date
- [ ] **Code comments** don't contain sensitive information
- [ ] **Test data** doesn't include real sensitive locations

## üÜò Incident Response

In case of a confirmed security vulnerability:

1. **Immediate**: Assess impact and develop fix
2. **Communication**: Notify affected users through GitHub security advisories
3. **Patch Release**: Deploy fix as soon as possible
4. **Documentation**: Update security documentation and practices
5. **Prevention**: Implement measures to prevent similar issues

## üìû Contact Information

- **Security Issues**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
- **General Questions**: Open a GitHub issue with the `security` label
- **Project Maintainers**: See CONTRIBUTORS.md for current maintainer list

## üîÑ Policy Updates

This security policy will be reviewed and updated:
- **Quarterly**: Regular review of practices and procedures
- **After incidents**: Following any security-related issues
- **Version releases**: With major version updates
- **Community feedback**: Based on user and contributor input
